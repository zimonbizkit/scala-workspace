    //below won't work as Any is a generic type and we cannot add 5 to a generic type for which we don't know the
    // underlying type.

    //so how can we write a function whose signature is as type-agnostic as possible, and at the same time , let the
    // function understand and accept specific types?

    //logFn("hello",() => 5+5) +5

    // We can do this via parametrized types. We are telling, after the function name, that there will be
    // a generic type (T), that will have its second argument as a function that will return a generic type (T)
    // and return that generic type (T), this way we can ensure that the function usage is agnostic from its definition
    // and that it can be defined regardles its use cases

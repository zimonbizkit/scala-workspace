# Scala workspace
Just to have an in-depth look on Scala and its ecosystem, so as to try to use it as a daily tool.

Apart from using it as a boilerplate for other projects, the aim of this repo is to put my personal implementation on challenges and exercises that I'm finding over a variety of resources that I'm using to learn Scala.

### Installation
Just execute `make up` and `make shell`,to enter the container with a specific java & scala version with sbt tool in it. For a list of commands (which is unfinished) execute `make help`.
